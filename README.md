## My open source website built with Vite
--------------------------
#### Welcome to the repository of my open source xtdrew website. Y'all can check out how my website works.
--------------------------
### FAQ - Website rewrite
##### Why did you change your website?
I thought of redesigning it, this time with prototyping, cuz I usually straight up code it.
##### Are you gonna do the same to the LayreBoi website?
No, I don't plan to do that currently.
##### Where's the old website?
The old website is now in `legacy.xtdrew.xyz` and keeps its [open source repository](https://github.com/layreboi/xthedrew-website).

--------------------------
### FAQ
##### Who is xtdrew / xthedrew?
I am xtdrew, a young programmer from Austria, and I develop web applications and Discord bots.

##### Where did you get your name?
I've got my name, xthedrew, from my older sister back in 2016, where she was creating an account for me in a rhythm game. Then at the beginning of 2022, I've decided to rename to xtdrew after I bought my domain "xtdrew.xyz"

##### Why did you change to xtdrew?
I bought my "xtdrew" domain because I wanted to shorten it a little bit.

##### How should I call you?
You can just call me Layre.
