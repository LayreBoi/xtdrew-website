### FAQ
##### Why did you change your website?
I thought of redesigning it, this time with prototyping, cuz I usually straight up code it.
##### Are you gonna do the same to the LayreBoi website?
No, I don't plan to do that currently.
##### Where's the old website?
The old website is now in `legacy.xtdrew.xyz` and keeps its [open source repository](https://github.com/layreboi/xthedrew-website).
